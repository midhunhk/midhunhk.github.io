I have worked on a broad range of software systems, but I focus mainly on HTML5 based **J2EE Enterprise applications** and **Native Android** application development at present. I have experience with Rich Internet Applications based on the **Flash platform** using Adobe Flex in the recent past.

I love to be updated with technology, design and UX in my spare time and have published a few apps on the play store.
