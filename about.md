  "No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun" - Time by Pink Floyd from The Dark Side of The Moon (1973)

I am a Software enthusiast, Android application developer, technical writer and open source contributor. I mainly listen to [Progressive and Alternative rock](https://open.spotify.com/user/ot6rqwy1bx1yfubp08uvx264k), watch all types of [movies](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30920712/?ref_=nb_usr_prof_0), read fiction (often) and loves [Photography](https://www.instagram.com/midhunhk).

Although I have worked on a broad range of software systems, at present I focus mainly on HTML5 based **J2EE** Enterprise applications, **Native Android** app development and few **Java** based products. I have experience in building Rich Internet Applications using the **Flash platform** with Adobe Flex in the past. 

Having learnt programming with **C and C++**, now I mainly use Java, **Kotlin**, JavaScript and **NodeJS**.

I keep myself updated with the latest technologies, design and UX in my spare time and have published a few apps on the play store.
