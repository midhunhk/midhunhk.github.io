This repository is the source for my personal blog located at [midhunhk.github.io](http://midhunhk.github.io).

The blog uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) which is a static site generator and [Poole](https://github.com/poole) to power with sample templates, pages, posts and styles. I am using the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme at present.

Publishing posts in Jekyll is very easy, once the base setup is completed. Just write an entry in markdown and push it to the `_posts` directory and you are done. The page is updated and ready for users. The maintanence effort is very less compared to a full blown blogging site like `Blogger` or `Wordpress`, if you simply want to run a basic blog site.

This site is based on Poole by Mark Otto.
