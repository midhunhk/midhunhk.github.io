## Personal Blog

This is my personal blog hosted at [midhunhk.github.io](http://midhunhk.github.io) and powered by Jekyll.

## What's Jekyll?

The blog uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) which is a static site generator and [Poole](https://github.com/poole) to power with sample templates, pages, posts and styles. I am using the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme at present.

## Benefits

Publishing posts in Jekyll is very easy after initial configuration is completed. 

Just write an entry in markdown and push it to the `_posts` directory and you are done. The page is updated and ready for users. The maintanence effort is very less compared to a full blown blogging site like `Blogger` or `Wordpress`.
