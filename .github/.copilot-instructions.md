# Introduction
This document provides instructions for GitHub Copilot to assist in generating code and documentation effectively. It outlines the context, guidelines, and examples to ensure high-quality outputs.
# Context
The code generated should be relevant to the context of the project, which is a personal blog and portfolio site. The focus is on web development, personal projects, and technology-related content.
# Technology Stack
The primary technologies used in the project include: jekyll for static site generation, bulma css for styling, and custom sass for additional styles. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages. There are also minimal amounts of vanilla javascript for enabling some functionality. 
# Guidelines
1. **Code Quality**: Ensure that the generated code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices for web development.
2. **Documentation**: Provide clear and concise comments in the code to explain functionality and usage.
3. **Relevance**: The generated code should be directly applicable to the context of the project, such as creating blog posts, managing content, or enhancing user experience.
4. **Performance**: Consider performance implications of the code, especially for web-related tasks.
