</div>

All of a sudden there was this [announcement](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/) from Microsoft's Satya Nadella. 
I have been a member of Github since 2012 and have most of my Open Source projects as well as [this blog](https://midhunhk.github.io) hosted there.
My first thought was "there goes my cloud repo".

<!-- more -->
## Cause for concern
As a developer, I have been burned by Microsoft on a couple of occassions, like when I had invested time and effort into learning [Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/),
only for them to introduce drastic changes and eventually deprecate the platform. That move is very similar to the change from AngularJS to Angular,
as I had the same issue after learning AngularJS along with the Ionic Platform.

Likewise I am glad, that I didn't spend time and effort into the Windows mobile platform which also seems to be dead. (I had the opportunity to 
learn and develop Android apps instead).

I absolutely hate the way Skype works as well as Internet Explorer. Haven't even tried Edge.

I'm sure people will have more examples. But I don't trust their intention yet, maybe a couple of years down the line rebrand GitHub 
as Visual Studio Code Repositoy and messup the system.

## Not to Worry?
Having ranted about all my concerns, the new Microsoft under Satya Nadella has embraced open source and contributes to a lot of Open 
Source tools and most usefully, Visual Studio Code. Taking about VS Code, this takeover could mean the end of [Atom](https://atom.io).
We just have to wait and see the direction they wpuld go with this acquisition.

## Next Steps
As with most developers, I went ahead and created an account in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/midhunhk) and imported all my 
[GitHub](https://github.com/midhunhk) projects there, as a sort of Cloud backup. It is an easy process and by signing up, I was able 
to get the same usename I have on GitHub as well.

For the time being, I would be keeping this blog hosted here and use GitHub repos as my primary Open Source repo and see how things 
develop.
