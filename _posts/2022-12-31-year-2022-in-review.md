Another year has seemingly flown past.

<!-- more -->

Here is my 2022 in summary.  

 * The New Year Started with me finally catching Covid-19 and was down for a couple of days. It does get all of us ultimately
 * Was able to do some long awaited trips like [100 Islands](https://www.localguidesconnect.com/t5/General-Discussion/Day-trip-to-1000-Islands-Ontario/m-p/3487887), [Prince Edward County](https://www.localguidesconnect.com/t5/General-Discussion/One-day-trip-to-Prince-Edward-County-Ontario/td-p/3440657) and a few more
 * With the announcement of [SvelteKit 1.0](https://svelte.dev/blog/announcing-sveltekit-1.0), it was not too difficult to upgrade the [org website](https://ae-app-labs.github.io/) to the latest version, although there were a few hiccups along the way. Planning to document this as a video tutorial in the future.
 * Made a couple of utility web apps
 * Continued with some more [technical tutorials](https://www.midhunhk.com/learning/2022/08/15/animated-hero-background/) in video format
 * Explored some [AI Image generation](https://www.midhunhk.com/learning/2022/12/16/exploring-ai-image-generator/) projects
 * Was not able to do much of any reading done this past year
