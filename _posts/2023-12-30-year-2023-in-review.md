Here is my year 2023 in review, as is tradition come December.

* Read a grand total of 1 book thsi year - [Origins by Neil deGrase Tyson](https://whitby.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S61C345592)
* Used Gen AI a lot into personal works, including Blog posts [Game Review](https://www.midhunhk.com/review/2023/02/15/ac2-review-by-ai/), [Front end Frameworks](https://www.midhunhk.com/review/2023/02/15/front-end-frameworks/), [Image Generation](https://www.midhunhk.com/review/2023/04/18/adobe-firefly/) and other projects
  * Added a prominent disclosure in all of such posts that AI tools were used to create those posts
* A huge effort to [migrate](https://www.midhunhk.com/learning/2023/10/20/updating-android-apps/) 6 of my Android apps to the lates SDK version
* Started with an [intro post](https://www.midhunhk.com/learning/2023/11/30/ux-in-movies/) to a series on UX in Movies, which I wanted to do for many many years
* Made an international trip after more than 5 years, a short visit to India to meet friends and families
* Polished and published a [css library](https://github.com/ae-app-labs/spork-css) project onto npm in an Alpha stage
* Signed up for some [fitness](https://www.orangetheory.com/en-ca) to stay in shape, not getting any younger
