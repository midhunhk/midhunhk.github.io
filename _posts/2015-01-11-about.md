I am a Software enthusiast, Android application developer, photography lover and open source contributor. I am currently based out of a small state called Kerala in India.

I have worked on a broad range of software systems, but currently I focus mainly on HTML5 based J2EE Enterprise applications and native android application development. I have experience with Rich Internet Applications based on the Flash platform using Adobe Flex in the recent past.

I read technical articles, Android design and development tips, play videogames, watch movies, do design and UX in my spare time. I have published a few apps on the play store, best of which have their source codes published as open source.

My OpenSource projects are at: https://github.com/midhunhk/
