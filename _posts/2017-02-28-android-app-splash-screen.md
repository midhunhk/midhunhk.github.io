![Trip O Meter](/public/images/tripometer_promo.png)

With the latest updates to Trip O Meter (codenamed Balanjar - Version 2.0), the app startup time has increased a bit. 
While I was not able to dig into the exact reason for the slowness, I thought about adding a Splash Screen while the app is loading.

I am sharing the implementation details from my research on this here.
