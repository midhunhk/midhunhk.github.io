The new year begins with an update to [Random Contact](https://github.com/midhunhk/random-contact). This update brings more Material Design Updates as well as a new fragment for showing Top Frequently Contacted Contacts.

What was once all code crammed into an Activity is now split into multiple Fragments and navigation is done with the help of the Nav Drawer and hamburger menu.

The Palette library is used even more to pick colors from contact's profile pictures to theme the UI for the app.

The app has now more than 500 downloads in the Google Play Store and you can tell me how to improve this app or add more features to make it useful.
