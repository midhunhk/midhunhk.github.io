title: Bye Bye 2015!
---

It was an aim to setup and start writing blog posts using Jekyll at the start of the year. Unfortunately, it is only at the end of the year that I am finally able to make this post by hand and commit via git commandline. This is a start, and now about that excercise that I promised to take up.

Apart from work, I spend most of my free time with my young son. It is very facinating to see him learn new things and you sense your priorities have changed after becoming a parent.
I had to find time for watching movies, read books, watch football and spend some time updating my apps while learning new things. Below are a snapshot of some main main things I got done in 2015.

* Include Material design in some apps
* Add Donate Option in MessageCounter (Someone is yet to donate)
* Complete reading "Cryptonomicon"
* Revisit RandomContact app after people are actually downloading this app

Heres to hoping next year to be more interesting and worthwhile!
