This is another follow-up to my earlier posts in this series, which lists the codenames used by the Android Messags app, after [Musical Instruments](https://midhunhk.github.io/review/2018/09/06/android-messages-codenames/), characters from [Dungeons and Dragons](https://midhunhk.github.io/review/2018/10/26/android-messages-mark-2/) and [Trees](https://www.midhunhk.com/review/2020/08/27/android-messages-again/). 

<!-- more -->

This post will likely be updated with this series of codenames, which look like fictional cities. Ofcourse we already have a list of [Lost Cities](https://github.com/midhunhk/trip-o-meter/wiki/Codenames) as codenames for the Trip Meter project.
