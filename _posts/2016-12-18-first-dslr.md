I finally made transition from a Point & Shoot camera to a DSLR. It was made possible with the Canon 700D and 18-55 and 55-250 lenses. I had been resarching to purchase a DSLR back when Canon 550D was in the market. It took me so many years to finally have

For me there was a lot to learn using DSLRs having used a Sony Cybershot for around 5 years. I started with Auto mode, moved quickly to Aperture Priority (AV) mode to fully Manual and to Semi Manual mode.

If you are planning to switch to a DSLR, do some research and may be try out a DSLR to see how it feels.
