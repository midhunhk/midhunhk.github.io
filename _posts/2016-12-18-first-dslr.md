I finally made transition from a Point & Shoot camera to a DSLR. It was made possible with the Canon 700D and 18-55 and 55-250 lenses. I had been researching to purchase a DSLR back when Canon 550D was in the market. It took me so many years to finally buy one and the 550D has stopped production so long ago.

For me there was a lot to learn using DSLRs having used a Sony Cybershot for around 5 years. I started with Auto mode, moved quickly to Aperture Priority (AV) mode to fully Manual and to Semi Manual mode. Learning about the Exposure triangle, Metering modes, Picture styles and finally ISO should have covered the most difficult things within a year.

Of course one should be aware of the main compositional rules that can be followed.

If you are planning to switch to a DSLR, do some research and may be try out a DSLR to see how it feels. The different terms and wealth of different camera models and lenses would confuse simple folks like me.

Personally it seems that I would prefer to have a 50mm prime and a 70-300 or 55-250 lens combinations. I very rarely use the 18-55mm lens if at all, maybe due to the photos I take.
