2020 was looked upon as the start of a new decade and we were all looking forward to a great and prosperous year. However it has been more of a reset. 

It has given us a chance to pause the rush, evaluate life and our priorities. We have to stand together, think and care for everyone.

Here is my 2020 in summary.

* Started the year with some research into understanding String theory 
* Finally bought myself my very own laptop
* Finally learned SASS and started using [Adobe XD](https://midhunhk.github.io/review/2020/11/12/adobe-xd/) for all my design works
* Updated my [bio](https://midhunhk.github.io/bio/) page to a proper version
* Created some full stack applications with [React](https://midhunhk.github.io/dev/2020/08/20/reactjs-book-store-app/) and [NodeJS](https://github.com/midhunhk/c19-web-api)
* Developed a [C19 Counter Android App](https://github.com/midhunhk/c19-counter-app) which was suspended by Google Play
* The lack of commute for work or anything resulted in my lower Podcast listening, but increased the number of [movies and series](https://letterboxd.com/midhunhk/) that I was able to consume
* Revisited [Assassin's Creed](https://midhunhk.github.io/review/2020/05/18/revisiting-ac1/) and a few other old games
* Changed my job after a glorious 7 and half years at my previous employer
