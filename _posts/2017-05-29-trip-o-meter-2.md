A huge update for Trip O Meter was completed last month. A quick glance over the change log as follows.

 - Added "Trip Expenses" feature
 - More than *180 change sets* committed
 - More than *70 files* created or modified
 - Supports Permission checks for Marshmallow and Up
 - Refreshed UI
 
By the sheer volume of change, this has been the biggest app update I have worked on. "Trip Expenses" allows you to manage your expenses while on a trip. Setup a trip and add your expenses, and the app would calculate the share for each person.

The latest version of Trip O Meter is available on the Google Play Store now.
