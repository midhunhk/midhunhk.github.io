Ever since I heard Lambdas as one of the new features of Java 8, I did some research on it and ended up not understanding it at all. Other than some relation with complex mathematical terms, there was nothing I could understand about this.

This week, while watching a session on Advanced Javascript, I came across some Closure examples.

After setting up Eclipse Neon and JDK8, the first thing I tried was to write an example Lambda expression. It was then that a colleague of mine, <a href="https://github.com/RaghuChandrasekaran">Raghu</a> directed me to a real life example for lambdas which was simple to understand.

Pre Java 8, this was acheived with an anonymous inner function like below.

Other than being less "looking like code", this does the same job. So thats that!
