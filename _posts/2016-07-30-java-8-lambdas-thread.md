title: Lamba expressions in Java 8
---
Ever since I heard Lambdas as one of the new features of Java 8, I tried reading some examples and ended by not understanding this feature.

While watching a session on <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-javascript/">"Advanced Javascript"</a> by <a href="http://getify.me">Kyle Simpson</a>, I came across how Closures were implemented in JavaScript.
After understanding a little bit more about closures, a colleague of mine directed me to a consice way of getting a real life example for lambdas that I could understand.
