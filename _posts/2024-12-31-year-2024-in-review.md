Here is my year 2024 in review, as is tradition come December. 

It was a difficult year on account of many things and on many levels, but I would like to be thankful for the many people who have shown kindness and helped in many ways.

* Read a grand total of 1 book again this year [Quantum Mechanics Demystified](https://whitby.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S61C479980)
* Decided to finally publish an article on [UX in Movies](https://www.midhunhk.com/learning/2024/01/01/ux-in-movies-part-1/), the concept and data for which I had been collecting for many years. Although planned as a series, part 2 is still to come out.
* Dabbled with Generative AI for creating [a story from an incident](https://www.midhunhk.com/learning/2024/06/24/the-plate-collector/) as well as a [collaboration post](https://www.midhunhk.com/learning/2024/07/04/beyond-automation/) 
* A lot of time was spent on [updating my android apps](https://www.midhunhk.com/dev/2024/07/12/duplicate-google-play-core/) and [lib-aeapps](https://github.com/midhunhk/lib-aeapps) which moved to Beta
* After spending some time researching quantum computing and taking a course, finally got around to present those information in a [length article](https://www.midhunhk.com/learning/2024/08/07/quantum-computing/)
* And finally a few minor iterations and simplifications were done on [this blog](https://www.midhunhk.com/blog/)
* Worked on a Spring Boot course, but did not get anywhere
* Kind of learned Godot and followed along to create a couple of playable games [RPG Game](https://github.com/ae-app-labs/godot-rpg-game) and [Space Shooter](https://github.com/ae-app-labs/godot-space-shooter)
* Watched [102+](https://letterboxd.com/midhunhk/films/diary/for/2024/) movies this year, few of them at the theatre

Overall, I thought 2023 was bad but turned out 2024 was even harder. Here to a prosperous year ahead.
