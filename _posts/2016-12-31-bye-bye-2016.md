Whoa, A year went by so fast. I still remember setting up this blog and writing the [Bye Bye 2015](https://github.com/midhunhk) post, which seem a few months back.

Here are the highlights from 2016.

* [Migrated](https://github.com/midhunhk) few Android apps to Android Studio
* Won a Quarterly award at work
* Reading the third book by Robert Galbraith - [Career of Evil](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Career-Cormoran-Strike-Robert-Galbraith/dp/0751562270)
* [Finally bought a DSLR](http://midhunhk.github.io/2016/12/18/first-dslr/)
* Took some technical courses and now I know a little bit more Javascript, Java 8 and Bootstrap thanks to [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)
* Went for a Pondichery Trip as well as few short trips

Nothing major to note from music scene, but watched a few movies.

It seems that I have blogged lesser than I had hoped this past year. Need to blog more often. Some long travel trips also need to be made.
