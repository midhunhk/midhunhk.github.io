This is a followup post to my earlier [post](http://midhunhk.github.io/dev/2018/09/06/android-messages-codenames/) which listed the internal codenames
that were used by the official Android Messages app. It ended with them coming to the end of the Alphabetic order with "Zither" and another update with 
"Nose Flute". 

A new version has now been released!
<!-- more -->
It looks like characters from the world of Dungeons and Dragons or World of Warcraft. We will be able to confirm with upcoming versions.

| Version | Codename |
|---------|----------|
| 3.7     | Axebeak  |

I will probably keep updating this table with each new release of the said app.
