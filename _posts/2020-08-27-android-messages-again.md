This is another follow-up to my earlier posts in this series, which lists the codenames used by the Android Messags app, after [Musical Instruments](https://midhunhk.github.io/review/2018/09/06/android-messages-codenames/) and characters from [Dungeons and Dragons](https://midhunhk.github.io/review/2018/10/26/android-messages-mark-2/). 

With the Android team dicontinuing the highly awaited "dessert codename" of each major release, this seems like a good detour!

This post will likely be updated with this series of codenames, which look like types of trees or shrubs.  
There are a few fictional characters with connections to "trees"
