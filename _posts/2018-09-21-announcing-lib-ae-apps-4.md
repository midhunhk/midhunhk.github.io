</div>
Just after the hard work on [Message Counter](http://midhunhk.github.io/message-counter) was completed and the app was released 
to the public, I have taken up another major app rewriting task. This time it's [LibAeApps](https://github.com/midhunhk/ae-apps-library).

<!-- more -->

The "AeAppsLibrary" also called "libAeApps" is an Android library project that I use as library project with common functionality 
that I use for my Android Apps. 

Version 4 of libAeApps aims to restructure the library as well as to separate functionality into separate 
modules. Not all of the features of the library may be needed by an app, also this presents an opportunity to refactor some implementations 
as well as to remove legady and deprecated components.

At present, there is no immediate stable release planned for the library, but I would continue to invest time to carefully improve the library.
