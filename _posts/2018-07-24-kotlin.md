Ever since Google made [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) the official language of Android, I had tried to look at it. As usual I tried it out as part of [RandomContact](http://midhunhk.github.io/random-contact/) app 
and just used a few simple features and found it to be consice and powerful. So when I wanted to rewrie [MessageCounter](http://midhunhk.github.io/message-counter/) app to make use of Android 
Architecture Components, I decided to jump all in and rewrite the entire app in Kotlin. Below are few snippets that I came across and liked a lot.

1. Data Classes  
Creating a data or POJO class is so easy using the data keyword. It automatically generates a constructor, all setters and getters 
as well as equals and hashcode methods. This reduces a lot of boiler plate code especially if there are a lot of members. We can also create secondary 
constructors which have can assign default values for certain fields.

2. String Concatenation  
Rather than join some strings using `+` operator, kotlin provides String interpolation as below.

3. Creating lists or maps  
After creating a `List` type object, I was looking for an add method which was not found. Thats when I understoord that Lists are immutable by default.
You need to create a list of type `MutableList` to be able to add data to it.
