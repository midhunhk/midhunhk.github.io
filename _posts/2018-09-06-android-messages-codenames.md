The latest release of **Android Messages** app from Google had just hit the playstore featuring Material Theme. I was able to trace back 
the internal codenames of the app.
<!-- more -->
The code names are part of the application version name from version code 2.1 and up and they are. They seem to be related to music, most of them 
being musical instruments from different parts of the world.

  - Naqara
  - Ocarina
  - Piccolo
  - Ramwong
  - Sarangi
  - Tuba
  - Ukelele
  - Vuvuzela
  - Whistle
  - Xylophone
  - Yehu (Version 3.4)
  - Zither (Version 3.5)
  
Another interesting thing to note is that they have reached code name with **Z** and we have to wait and see what code name they would 
be using for the next version. Either restart with *A* or maybe use a new theme.

As a side note, Google Play Music app just has an alphabet as code along with version number, that has circled past Z atleast once.
