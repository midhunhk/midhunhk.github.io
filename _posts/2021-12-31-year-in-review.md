This year has flown past especially towards the latter stages of the year, as I had plans to take a Cloud Certification before the year is up. 
Whether it is the busy schedule or procrastinating  with the learning until the exam is scheduled, I can't tell to be certain.

Here is my 2021 in summary.  

* The major update is that I finally bought a domain name for myself for this blog and other projects.
* It also involved some [updates](https://www.midhunhk.com/project/2021/04/22/two-projects/) to the blog itself.
* The year actually started with the redesign and rewriting of the [Random Contact](https://www.midhunhk.com/dev/2021/03/25/random-contact-update/) Android app
* With that done, I have moved out of the Android ecosystem for now and using my iPhone as a daily driver.
* This was the year that I finally found some time to create some [technical tutorials in video form](https://www.midhunhk.com/learning/2021/07/12/creating-technical-tutorials/).
* And finally I was able to create a Web version of [CryptX](https://www.midhunhk.com/project/2021/11/23/cryptx-web/) in less than a day using Svelete and Bulma.
