Hello dear reader. I welcome 2017 with a new Android app announcement. 

## Trip O Meter
Trip O Meter started out as a simple idea to know how much fuel would be needed when making a trip. I just wanted to make sure there was sufficient amount of fuel while planning. 

## Codenames
As with most software projects, we are following development codenames for each version. The theme for Trip O Meter's code names are [Lost Cities](https://github.com/midhunhk/trip-o-meter/wiki/Codenames) in alphabetical order. These are some cities which are mythical or real and were lost at some point in time. A few of them have since been rediscovered.

The first version is codenamed **Atlantis**.

## Collaboration
I am collaborating with another open source developer to bring real time fuel prices to the app. First phase would be for each state in **India**. While the web APIs are getting ready, the focus for the app is now on...

## Trip Expenses
When going for a trip with friends, there is bound to be a calculation of each person's expense share. This was a problem faced by me and my friends couple of times. The next update should make it easier for calculating individual share amounts.
